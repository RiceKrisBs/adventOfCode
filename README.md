## Helpers
The [getAocInput](helpers/getAocInput) shell script can be used to download input for any day/year. Putting the location of this script on your PATH is convenient. The script depends on the folder structure of this repo, so it won't work if you try to simply take this script and execute it from an arbitrary location.

## Templates
The [templates](templates) folder contains some common code scaffolding that help support using test inputs and some basic input parsing that I've found usful.
